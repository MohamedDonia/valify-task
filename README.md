# Sign Language Classifier

With sign language, we can provide a way of communication without the use of voice.  This is very 
importantfor individuals who have impaired hearing and inability speaking because it provides them 
an alternativemeans of communicating with other people.  Furthermore, sign language is an universal 
language that canallow people of different speaking language to communicate.To understand sign language
is challenge since it requires memorizing a lot of hand poses and gestures.  somesigns even have very 
similar appearance.  So we need an automatic sign language recognition system allowinganyone to 
understand sign languages.


In this repo, we will go through dataset and inspect it, train different models on the datatset to 
compareresults, perform cross validation and deploy model to put into production.

## Dataset

The  dataset  used  was  based  on  the  American  Finger  Spelling  format.
